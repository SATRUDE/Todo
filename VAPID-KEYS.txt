VAPID Keys for Push Notifications
==================================

IMPORTANT: Keep the private key secure! Only use it on your backend server.

Public Key (already added to .env):
VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=BDJ7TIDnLub_PRAIaCLV0Lq2_7B879nLZfVcA5bz3BF86p7uyiNRURiN28XATbUtkJY0NIZYCUHXES5hZa46Mp4

Private Key (use this on your backend only):
pbaPnvtnpo-J8UlIAtU_v1FIj4Qxru8JcnPj-L8lV6A

==================================
Next Steps:
1. The public key is already in your .env file
2. Add the public key to Vercel environment variables as VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY
3. Use the private key on your backend server to send push notifications
4. Restart your dev server to load the new environment variable
